# MAST-680
A repository for the course MAST 680, Data Driven Methods in Dynamical Systems.

The repository contains the files for:

Assignment 1: Background Subtraction in Video.
	- Description: An assignment that incorporates dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) with low-rank and 	               sparse reconstruction to find the moving foreground in a video.

Assignment 2: Learning Dynamics from Video.
	- Description: An assignment that uses sparse identification of non-linear dynamics (SINDY) to 		               discover the governing equations of a mass-spring system in a video.

Assignment 3: Forecasting Chaos with Neural Networks.
	- Description: An assignment that uses neural networks to forcast the dynamics of the Lorenz 						      equations.


Final Project:  Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) in Salient Region Detection.
	- Description: A project which explores the use of dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) to help 								 identify the salient regions in a static image. This is an attempt to recreate the 						 results of the work of Sikha et al (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jocs.2017.07.007)
